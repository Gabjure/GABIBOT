# CHATBOT

>A *chatbot* (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. — Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot (last update: 16 May 2020)

--TIMELINE OF BOTS

## Types of C.BOTS
  **1. Rule-Based C.bots**:
    
   These bots can answers questions based on the rules on which they were trained. The rules defined can go from simple to very complex ones. But if asked something it was not trained for the bot will fail to give a correct response, that is why the bots can handle simple queries but fail to manage complex ones and why *Rule-based* bots can not pass the Turing test.

  **2. Self-learning C.bots**:
  
  These bots are more efficient than rule-based bots because they rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). <br>
  There are two types of Self-learning C.bots:
    
   2.1 Retrieval Based Chatbots:
    
   As the name says it retrieves the answer, the bot considers best ranked, from a finite set of responses. The principle is that of directed flows/graphs. The responses are manually entered or based on pre-existing information, it can also be integrated with 3rd Party systems (i.e: online store with the transport company)
        
        >Eg. Where is my order?
        >Answer: It’s on its way and should reach you in 10 mins
        
   2.2 Generative Chatbots:
    
   Contrary to the Retrieval Based bots, Generative bots use, as it's name states, a generative model. It means they responseses are... generated. This bots don't have predefined responses, they are trained with previous conversations on which the responses are... surprise... generated. A handicap when creating a Generative Chatbot is the ginormous amout of data we have to train. Other issues when using it are: responses might seem arbritary and not make sense; and its proneness to incorrect grammar and syntax.
